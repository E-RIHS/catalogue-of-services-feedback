This repository provides a shared space to report issues, suggest improvements, and discuss the structure and behaviour of the E-RIHS Catalogue of Services.

## Purpose

The E-RIHS Catalogue of Services is a central discovery tool for Heritage Science services offered through E-RIHS. These include services originating from FIXLAB, MOLAB, ARCHLAB, and increasingly digital and data-oriented services under DIGILAB.

This repository is **not** intended for reporting problems with individual services themselves.  
Instead, it focuses on:

- How the catalogue functions
- How services are described and categorised
- User experience and navigation
- Metadata structure and terminology
- Representation of digital services (DIGILAB)
- Suggestions for new types of services or descriptors

The goal is to support the ongoing development, usability, and interoperability of the catalogue as a research infrastructure tool for the Heritage Science community.

## What should be reported here?

Please open an issue if you notice or would like to propose:

- Problems with catalogue functionality or behaviour
- Inconsistencies in how services are described
- Missing fields or descriptors for certain types of services
- Difficulties finding or comparing services
- Suggestions to improve representation of DIGILAB or digital services
- Feedback from users, service providers, or infrastructure partners

## What should NOT be reported here?

This repository does **not** handle:

- Technical problems with a specific FIXLAB, MOLAB, ARCHLAB, or DIGILAB service
- Access requests or service application issues
- Scientific questions about individual services

For these matters, please contact the relevant service provider directly via the information given in the catalogue entry.

## Scope of Services

The catalogue currently includes services from:

- FIXLAB (fixed instrument laboratories)
- MOLAB (mobile laboratories)
- ARCHLAB (archive-based research services)
- DIGILAB (digital and data-driven services)

While all categories are in scope, particular attention is expected for:
- Representation and discovery of DIGILAB services
- Describing digital workflows, datasets, and research infrastructures

## How to Contribute

1. Check if a similar issue already exists.
2. Open a new Issue using a clear title.
3. Describe:
   - What part of the catalogue is affected (URL if possible)
   - What you expected
   - What you observed
   - Suggested improvement (if applicable)

Screenshots or examples are very helpful but not required.

## Issue Labels

To help organise feedback, issues are categorised using the following labels:

- bug – Catalogue functionality not working as expected  
- ux – Navigation, layout, or usability concerns  
- catalogue-structure – Classification, grouping, or filtering logic  
- service-description – How a service is presented or characterised  
- terminology – Controlled terms, definitions, or naming issues  
- digilab – Issues specific to digital/DIGILAB services  
- documentation – Improvements or additions to documentation  
- enhancement – Suggestions for new features or improvements  
- wish-list – Longer-term ideas that may inform future development stages  
- discussion – Open conceptual or governance questions about the catalogue  
- question – Clarification requests about current catalogue behaviour  
- duplicate – This issue or pull request already exists


## Governance and Moderation

Issues will be reviewed by members of the E-RIHS Catalogue development and coordination teams. Discussions are welcome from:

- Service providers
- Heritage scientists
- Research infrastructure partners
- Developers and data specialists

This repository aims to support open, constructive discussion that helps improve the catalogue for the whole Heritage Science community.

## Relationship to Other Platforms

This repository complements, but does not replace:

- Direct communication with individual service providers
- E-RIHS internal coordination channels
- DIGILAB related development discussions

It provides a transparent, citable record of proposed improvements and community feedback on the catalogue itself.
